<h1>MERN Instagram Clone - "M"</h1>
<p>Welcome to M, a full-stack Instagram clone built using the MERN stack. This project replicates the core functionalities of Instagram, allowing users to save photos, like and comment on posts, and connect with others.</p>
<p>PS: This is my first FULL-STACK App. I'm very proud of it. It took me a month of writing and debugging. I know it ain't perfect but it means a lot to me.</p>
